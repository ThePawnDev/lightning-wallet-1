My first webapp project of a ln wallet on Javascript and React.

It is deployd on Vercel in this "watch only" preview (with no admin keys):
https://lightning-wallet-1.vercel.app/

Start your demo wallet on lnbits.com,
save your API keys in a .env file as REAC_APP_READ_KEY and REACT_APP_ADMIN_KEY,
and npm start it to run your own working instance!

Enjoy and let me know about any possible bugs or improvements!
